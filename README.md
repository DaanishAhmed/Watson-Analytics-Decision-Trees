Decision Tree Analysis on Categorical and Continuous Data
----------------

This project involves the use of Watson Analytics to analyze two datasets: a customer churn dataset with a categorical target, and a sales profits and costs dataset with a continuous target.  I used decision trees to classify the outcomes for both datasets.  My goal in the churn dataset is to predict whether a customer will churn, whereas my goal in the sales dataset is to maximize the gross profit.  I then evaluated whether the solutions provided by the decision trees were attainable by my organization.

The full report can be found in the file "Decision Trees.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data cleansing and preparation, model development, model results, model tuning, applications, and proposed solutions.  Tables and visualizations are included in the appendix.

The datasets are located in the files "Telco-Customer-Churn.csv" and "Retail-SalesMarketing_-ProfitCost.csv".  I have included cleaned versions of these files in which I handled outliers, missing values, and errors.  These cleaned files are the ones used in Watson Analytics.  The original files were obtained from IBM's list of sample datasets:
